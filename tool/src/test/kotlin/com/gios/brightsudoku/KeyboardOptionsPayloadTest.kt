/**
 * The keyboard-options payload, read the way a tool reads it on a phone it does not know.
 *
 * A tool is installed once and then outlives whatever LightOS build it was compiled against, so
 * the service on the other end of the wire drifts under it in both directions: it learns to send
 * fields the tool has never heard of, and it stops sending fields the tool used to require. The
 * second one is the dangerous half, because to kotlinx.serialization a nullable property with no
 * default is still a *required* property — a newer server that omits a null field instead of
 * writing `null` makes the decode throw, the throw escapes the coroutine that asked, and the
 * tool dies the moment it opens a screen with a text field in it. That is the whole bug: nothing
 * was wrong with the keyboard, only with reading the phone's answer about it.
 *
 * These pin both directions on the one payload that every text-entry screen fetches.
